Solution
Go to "headerinclude" ~ It can be found in Ungrouped Templates. Paste This at the very bottom. (Click to View) *

<script type="text/javascript" src="{$mybb->settings['bburl']}/jscripts/tabcontent.js">
/***********************************************

* This notice MUST stay intact for legal use
* Visit Dynamic Drive at http://www.dynamicdrive.com/ for full source code
***********************************************/
</script> 

* not needed anymore as the template insert is done by the plugin

Question
The tabs are not working for members, but for Staff it works great?
Solution
Forums or Catergories with special permissions cannot be placed at the top of the tab. Example VIP Sections

Question
A category is just floating around on each tab?
Solution
The catergory hasnt been assigned a tab. Multiple catergories per tag can be achieved by holding CTRL while selecting the catergories.

Question
The Tabbed Menu ain't working with another theme?
Solution
1st. Create a tabbed.css in your new theme, and copy the code from tabbed.css in the other theme.
Then follow Labrocca's troubleshooting guide and this guide.

Question
How do I organize the tabs?
Solution :
There currently is no organizing system. Create the number of tabs you require with numbered names, check their order on your forum, then assign the catergories to the relevant tabs.

Question
Why can't I download the Tabbed Menu plugin?
Solution
You have to upgrade to download attachments at MyBBCentral.com

Question
This does not work on 1.6?
Solution
Yes, after following this guide.

Question
There are double tabs?
Solution
Go to the index template, and ensure that only one {tabmenu} appears.
